# Roadmap

## Functional Tasks

### Integrate interest rate in performance report forecast

### Improve import matching logic

- [ ] Fund matchers should be applicable to all import parsers. Actual case, implicit fund transfer for investment
  accounts interest transactions.
- [ ] Check common logic between Import Parser implementations
- [ ] Find a common strategy for transactionId generation
- [ ] Allow multiple matching per matcher to simplify request definition
- [ ] verify that bt work taxes are correctly imported (ex. May CASS payment). Also check September 2021 minus.
- [ ] verify that distributed profit are correctly imported in investment accounts for currency interests

### Calculate interest rate when positions are closed

### UI, step 1

Anything, just have some AI and integrate the backend. Planning to use KMP would be great.

### Integrate Pricing for ICBETNETF

### Decouple Report View from Report Data requests

The report view could be considered just a template for a dashboard. Its setting would be used to load the report data.
But report data generation shouldn't depend on the report view.

### Add absolute changes in interest rate report

## Infrastructure

### Improve Docker usage

- [ ] Have a bridge network
- [ ] Separate non-functional services from normal deployment

### Deployment option in kubernetes

Have it deployed with Helm Charts in kubernetes. At least locally in a minikube.

### Store CSV files in S3

## Non-Functional Tasks

### Remove unused account service

### Use sealed class on Records so Currency and Instrument record can be separated.

look for situations where a cast is used "as Instrument" or "as Currency". those could be replaced

### Integrate automatic linting

Integrate ktlint maybe. It could be applied automatically using Claude Code hooks.

### Keep transactions and their records in the same table

This would make more sense, records should be directly attached and depend on transaction lifecycle.
GIN index could be used to filter by fundId.

### Investigate and understand the Exposed potential bug

Check AccountTransactionRepositoryTest

### Investigate & improve sealed classes' serialization

There seem to be another option to handle it with
SerializersModule: https://www.baeldung.com/kotlin/sealed-class-serialization
This would eliminate the need to use @OptIn(ExperimentalSerializationApi::class)

### Improve Historical Pricing Service code

- [ ] Evaluate Instrument management
- [ ] Evaluate HistoricalPriceSource enum
- [ ] Remove User scope
- [ ] Is it really needed to have separate repositories for currency and instrument prices?
- [ ] Evaluate the separation of Instrument vs Currency *HistoricalPriceRepository-es
- [ ] use kotlinx.time in FinancialTimesInstrumentConverter
- [ ] take responsibility of current code in reporting ConversionRateService
- [ ] Check ConversionsResponse::getRate in historical pricing api model

### Improve Reporting Service code

- [ ] make error handling exhaustive
- [ ] check handling of conversion request errors
- [ ] previous records should be resolved only for the resolvers needed them

### Caching capabilities for HistoricalPricingSDK

- [ ] SDK should take responsibility over the current code in reporting ConversionRateService
- [ ] Find a suitable in-memory caching solution
- [ ] Check error handling
- [ ] Look for same currency conversion, maybe it shouldn't trigger a request
